# TinyML Course - HardvardX

This repository contains the notebooks from the course [HarvardX: Fundamentals of TinyML](https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning/harvard-university-fundamentals-of-tinyml), offered by [HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx).
The course is an introduction to machine learning and its applications to embedded systems - such as smartphones or Arduino boards - complete with hands-on exercises on Google Colab.

Here, I uploaded the **exercises** that I successfully carried out from the notebooks offered during this course. All cells have been stripped out of their outputs.
